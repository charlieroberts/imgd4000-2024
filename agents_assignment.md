# IMGD4000: Agent-based simulation assignment
One goal for this assignment, to implement the [Boids algorithm](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html), originally presented [in a classic paper that has been cited over 11000 times](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiqy5OP_tPoAhWDuJ4KHdqmDH4QFjACegQIIhAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.toronto.edu%2F~dt%2Fsiggraph97-course%2Fcwr87%2F&usg=AOvVaw2StOMrXs0E_nHLgD87UrGN).

[Here’s a video of the original simulation in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86iQiV3-3IA). 
For an in-depth treatment of agent-based steering algorithms more generally (including Boids) 
try [this chapter from the Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/). 
The author of this chapter also walks through implementing the algorithm (in 2D) 
in [his amazing Coding Train series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM). 
But the first link in this assignment is perhaps the easiest to follow, with clear pseudocode and explanations of the algorithm.
We will also be doing some basic setup for this assignment in class... you might want to wait until then to complete this.

## Requirements
1. Implement Boids in C++. 
2. Create a gameplay video and post it.
4. Post your repo to GitHub. Include a README that describes your game and links to your gameplay video.
5. DM me the repo link in Slack by the last day of class.

## Grading
60% : Are the three basic rules of boids implemented correctly (20% for each rule)  
20% : implement one of the tweaks (your choice) described at the [algorithm overview](http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html)  
20% : correctly followed instructions (posted video, made GitHub repo etc.)
